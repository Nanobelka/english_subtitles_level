[Chuckles] They think they\\'ve finished me off. They don\\'t know how tough we secret agents are. This is Secret Agent Rock Slag reporting to Chief Boulder. Come in, Chief. This is Chief Boulder. Anything wrong, Slag? Plenty. Ali and Bobo, strong-arm boys, got me cornered and tried to do me in. Are you OK, Slag? Well, I think I\\'ve twisted my tibia, and cracked my clavicle, Chief. Stay there, Slag. I\\'ll get an ambulance to you right away. Right, Chief. Cracked clavicle-- that\\'s a bad break, just as we were closing in on the Green Goose and his nefarious SMIRK organization. The whole world is in peril as long as the Green Goose is loose. Operator, get me the Bedrock Hospital. Oh, Wilma! We\\'re gonna leave now. WILMA: OK, Fred. But please hurry. We still have a lot of packing to do. Be back right after we take Dino and Hoppy to, uh, you know where. I don\\'t envy the boys. Dino and Hoppy always put up such a fuss when they go to the vet\\'s. It\\'s a shame we can\\'t take them with us. I\\'m gonna miss Hoppy. I\\'m gonna miss Dino, too. But a camping vacation is bad enough without dragging pets along. How true. Seems like there\\'s a million and one things to do when you\\'re going on a trip, huh, Barney? Yeah. We darn near forgot to take Dino and Hoppy to-- Don\\'t say it, Barn! Oops, I almost gave it away. Watch it. If those 2 knew we were gonna leave \\'em at the v-e-t-s, for 2 weeks they\\'d take to the woods. Well, uh, how we gonna get \\'em in the office, Fred? We\\'ll sneak up the back alley. They\\'ve never been taken inside that way before. Hey, that\\'s a good idea. [Laughs] Come on, Dino. We gotta see a man about something.

Dino, come back here! Come-- Look out, Fred, comin\\' through! Oops! Oh, boy. Mr Flintstone! Mr Rubble! You\\'re going about it all wrong. You have to use psychology. Psychology? What do you mean, Doc? I\\'ll show you. Miss Soapstone, send Zsa Zsa and Dolly out here. Yes, sir. Who is Zsa Zsa? And Dolly? Zsa Zsa is a girl hoparoo, and Dolly is a girl dinosaur. Watch this.

Uh, huh? What? Oh, boy. Thanks, Fred. That psychology stuff was working on me, too. [Both Laughing] I hope the girls have everything packed. I\\'m anxious to get started. Me, too. Hey, where you going, Fred? This is the way to Rock Canyon Road. Right, Barn. We\\'ll save 10 minutes going home this way. But Rock Canyon Road is closed. It\\'s too dangerous! Not for a good driver like me. Hold on, Barn, here we are. We ought to have seat belts, Fred! Oh, who needs \\'em? There, we\\'re down. How is that for skilful driving? Oh, my goodness, Fred! Are you all right? Oh-- Oh, my head! Boy, that\\'s some bump. Ooh! Hey, we\\'d better get you to a doctor. FRED: No, that\\'s not necessary. Oh, I don\\'t know, Fred. It won\\'t hurt to have your head examined. BARNEY: Here we are... The Bedrock Hospital. It\\'ll only take a minute. You wait here, I\\'ll go find a doctor. Make it snappy, will ya? I feel OK now. Uh, pardon me, Nurse. My friend needs to see a doctor. You\\'ll have to wait. All the doctors are busy with a patient who fell off a roof last night. Fell off a roof? Is he hurt? I\\'ll say. They\\'ve been working on him all night. FIRST DOCTOR: Hold it. You\\'ve got his head on backwards. SECOND DOCTOR: Well, twist it around. OK, that\\'s enough. Now, cut! How are you doing, Irving? Be finished in a minute. Nurse! [Clanking] There, we\\'ve finished. The statue looks just like new. When the cement dries, he can go back on the roof. How about the man who fell with him? How\\'s he doing? Not bad. Dr Moonstone is taking care of him. Dr Moonstone, I\\'m Chief Boulder, head of this country\\'s Secret Service. And your patient is Rock Slag, my best agent. Thanks, Chief. CHIEF: Doc, you must get Rock back on his feet quickly. He\\'s the only agent I have capable of carrying out a very important and dangerous mission. Rock Slag survive fall. He is still alive, Bobo. Our work is not done, Ali. Mr Slag can leave any time. He just bruised a few ribs. So, now if you\\'ll excuse me, I\\'ll just look in on my other patients. Sure, Doc, sure. And, uh, thanks. That\\'s great news. What\\'s this important mission, Chief? The biggest yet. You\\'re going to eliminate the guy that tried to eliminate you. ROCK: You mean the Green Goose. Yes! Intelligence reports he has a weapon so powerful he could destroy the world. And probably will, unless-- NURSE: Rock Slag! Ooh! [Growls] Mmm! [Giggles] Unless he is stopped. So you see, Slag, the safety of every man, woman, and child in every country depends on you. On me? Why me, Chief? CHIEF: It has to be you, Rock Slag. Rock Slag! Yum, yum, yum! Mmm! [Squeals and giggles] There\\'s your answer. You have an uncontrollable appeal to women. Yes, I know. But how can that help us, Chief? CHIEF: We\\'re going to put your gift to good use. How, Chief? Through Tanya, the Green Goose\\'s number one lieutenant. She\\'s heard about you, Rock. And she wants to meet you so badly, she\\'s made a deal with us to turn the Green Goose over to you! To me? That\\'s the deal. You\\'re going to meet her in Paris. When do I leave, Chief? At once. I\\'ll call the office and have them get your plane ticket. At last, Rock Slag is alone! Now we can finish the job. ALI: Hello, Rock Slag. Ali! Bobo! You\\'re taking a trip, Slag. A one-way trip, huh? Hee hee! Hee hee hee! Hee hee! This time we got him, Ali. Rock Slag is finished, Bobo! Hee hee! Hee hee hee! Hee hee! Ho ho! Ho ho! Hee hee! Hee hee! With Rock back on the job, the Green Goose\\'s goose is as good as cooked right now. Rock! What happened? While you were gone I had visitors, Chief. Ali and Bobo? Right. The goon twins. CHIEF: Well, that does it. Tanya will never go for you. You\\'re a mess! That cooks our Green Goose. I\\'ll try to heal fast, Chief. It won\\'t be fast enough, Rock. At any moment, the Green Goose may decide to take over the world. I\\'d better cancel your trip to Paris. Is this the patient? Uh, yeah, Doc. Fred Flintstone. He fell on his head. I\\'m OK now, Doc. I feel fine. Well, why don\\'t we check you over anyway? Come with me, Mr Flintstone. OK, but I\\'m telling you, it\\'s a waste of time. Hmm. Your pulse seems to be normal. Right on the button, in fact. Now cross your legs, and we\\'ll test your reflexes. Make it snappy, will ya, Doc? I\\'m on my vacation. We\\'re almost finished. Reflex is normal. [Mumbling] You can leave now, Mr Flintstone. Right after I give you a booster shot. Best to play it safe, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right. Let\\'s have the shot, Doc. I wanna get out of here. DOCTOR: You won\\'t even feel this, Mr Flintstone. FRED: Yeow! Watch it, Doc! What are you trying to do, put me in the hospital? It\\'s amazing! That man is a dead ringer for Rock Slag! Look at the size of this needle. What do you think I am, a brontosaurus? Why, he could be Rock\\'s twin! His twin! I wonder if-- Why not? It\\'s worth a try. Pardon me, sir. Can I have a word with you? Who, me? CHIEF: Yes. Your country needs you. My country needsme?! Now, let\\'s see if i got this straight. The government will send me and my family to Paris to pick up a Green Goose because I look like this guy? Right, Mr Flintstone. Your resemblance to our regular messenger is fantastic! And as you can see, he\\'s in no condition to make the trip. FRED: Yeah, I can see that. This Green Goose must be a very valuable bird. Very valuable. Our government wants to put him in a cage. I had planned a camping trip this year, but, uh, you did say all expenses paid? Every last penny. In that case, I\\'ll be glad to help the government get the Green Goose. CHIEF: Good. Now, raise your right hand. My right hand? And repeat after me. OK. I will not reveal my mission to anyone. I will not reveal my mission to anyone. Not even my wife. Not even my... wife?! Congratulations. You are now an official secret agent. Gosh! [Laughs] A spy-type guy. [Music starts] â\\x99ª He\\'s gonna be a spy â\\x99ª â\\x99ª A double zero guy â\\x99ª â\\x99ª He\\'s got that certain air â\\x99ª â\\x99ª Debonair â\\x99ª â\\x99ª Full of the old savoir-faire â\\x99ª â\\x99ª He\\'ll drive a jazzy car â\\x99ª â\\x99ª Like some big movie star â\\x99ª â\\x99ª And catch each lady\\'s eye â\\x99ª â\\x99ª A spy-type guy â\\x99ª â\\x99ª Ah-ta-shay â\\x99ª â\\x99ª He\\'ll carry an attache â\\x99ª â\\x99ª Don\\'t ask what\\'s an attache â\\x99ª â\\x99ª It fits in the briefcase â\\x99ª â\\x99ª All agents have \\'em â\\x99ª â\\x99ª If someone gets the drop â\\x99ª â\\x99ª With one karate chop â\\x99ª â\\x99ª He\\'ll send \\'em beddy-bye â\\x99ª â\\x99ª \\'Cause he\\'s the spy-type guy â\\x99ª â\\x99ª He can shoot â\\x99ª â\\x99ª A gun from his handmade boot â\\x99ª â\\x99ª His bulletproof, tailored suit â\\x99ª â\\x99ª Is really a whopper â\\x99ª â\\x99ª It\\'s a helicopper â\\x99ª â\\x99ª He\\'ll go from place to place â\\x99ª â\\x99ª And never leave a trace â\\x99ª â\\x99ª He\\'ll save the human race â\\x99ª â\\x99ª \\'Cause he\\'s spy-type â\\x99ª â\\x99ª Sly-type â\\x99ª â\\x99ª Spy-type â\\x99ª â\\x99ª Guy â\\x99ª [Music ends] All right, Flintstone, here are your plane tickets, and some money. You leave for Paris in the morning. Oh, boy! And, rember, your code name is Rock Slag. Gotcha. Rock Slag. Rock Slag, Rock Slag, Rock Slag. Chief, are you out of your mind? Why that guy is no match for the Green Goose and his gang! I know. But he\\'s our only chance. Besides, I\\'ll be there to keep an eye on him. You\\'d better, or that Flintstone will be in worse shape than I am! It\\'s a long shot, but he just may be able to pull it off. FRED: Hiya, Barney. Fred! Gee, I thought you\\'d never come out. What did the doc have to say? I\\'m OK, but I got to cancel the camping trip. Cancel the camping trip! Oh! There he is! Who? Who? Rock Slag! Rock Slag? Ooh! You naughty boy! Trying to leave without good-bye! [Kissing and giggling] Wow! What a hospital plan they have here. I don\\'t get it! Now, tell me, Fred. How come you gotta cancel our camping trip? Because Wilma and I are going to Paris. Paris! Stop the car, Fred. Stop the car! What\\'s the matter? Look, you got a bump on your head and now you think you\\'re going to Paris, right? FRED: Right. But to go to Paris you need A: money, and B: plane tickets. FRED: Here\\'s \"A.\" Money. And here\\'s \"B.\" Plane tickets. Gosh, Fred, what\\'s this all about? I\\'ll tell you later, pal. Right now, I want to see Wilma\\'s face when she hears the news. That was Rock Slag, Bobo! It can\\'t be, Ali. It was! He is still alive! Ooh, if we don\\'t get Slag, the Green Goose will get us! Quick, after him! Here he comes. We must not fail this time. Boy, this is a rough road! You\\'re not kidding. When I give the signal, you push the rock. BO: Right! Push the rock. Take it easy, Fred. We don\\'t want another accident. Whoops! Hey, look. The car is going right through the tunnel. ALI: Get ready, get set... Push! Hee hee! Hee hee hee! Hee hee! Hee hee! Right on target. That finishes Rock Slag. For keeps, this time. Hee hee! Hee hee! Ho ho! Ho ho! Hee hee! Hee hee! You almost didn\\'t make it to Paris, huh, Fred? Yeah. That boulder would have cancelled my trip permanently. I wonder what\\'s taking the boys so long? They\\'re waiting for us to finish packing, what else? Uh-oh! The trailer\\'s got a flat. WILMA: Just our luck. Well, we\\'d better change it and save some time. OK, I\\'ll get the spare. I\\'m always sticking my neck out for someone else. One spare, coming up! There, it\\'s fixed. Hiya, girls! Sorry we\\'re late. WILMA: Fred! How come you\\'re walking? Where\\'s the car? Oh, never mind that. Wait till you hear the news! What news? A little change in plans, my dear. Mr and Mrs Flintstone will be spending their vacation abroad this year in Paris, France. Paris? France? But--but--but how? What? I mean, when did-- Tut-tut, sweetheart. No questions, please. Just take my word for it. Paris! I can hardly believe it! Oh, you wonderful man! Mmm! Ooh, I\\'m so happy for you, Wilma. I wish we could take a trip like that. Hey, that\\'s a great idea! Look, Barney, we can get our money back on all the camping stuff we rented, and buy plane tickets for you and Betty and Bamm Bamm. Really, Fred? Do you think there would be enough? FRED: Sure! Maybe not enough for first class, or even second class. But at least we\\'d all be together. What do you say, Barn? I say put her there, buddy boy! You just talked me into it. Wilma, did you hear that? We\\'re going with you!

Fred, why don\\'t you get some magazines? Yeah, yeah. Good idea. Book! Book! And a colouring book for Pebbles. [Laughs] All right. I can hardly wait to report to the Green Goose how we eliminated Rock Slag. Look! Our reward will be great. Look! Look! By the newsstand. We\\'ll live like kings. We\\'ll die like dogs. Ooh! But how could it be? There\\'s not a scratch on him. When the Green Goose finds out we failed, there\\'ll be plenty of scratches onus. This time, I\\'ll make sure. You missed. Hee hee! Hee hee hee! Hee hee! Hee hee-- [Gulps, speaks pseudo-Japanese] Oh, how exciting. I\\'ve never been on a helicopter before. Hold on to Daddy, Pebbly-poo. Hedicopter! Whee! Eh hee hee hee.

Why is the flight deck way up here, pilot? Well, it\\'s a big aeroplane, so we use jet propulsion to get airborne. Jet propulsion? Yeah. You see, the plane is attached to that launching device at the edge of the cliff. When the pilot is ready, he gives the signal, the launching crew releases the retaining rope, and the plane takes off. Oh, my, what will they think of next? Come on, Wilma. Let\\'s get aboard. P.A.

There\\'s been a change in plans. The Green Goose has flown to Rome. You\\'ll have to go there immediately. Rome? I\\'ve just arrived in Paris. How will I explain it to Wilma? You\\'ll think of something. And how do I find the Green Goose in Rome? Triple X will help you. Triple X? Who\\'s he? Our top foreign agent, A master of disguise. I\\'ll show you. [Whistles] Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! Ruff! That\\'s Triple X? Mm-hmm. Meet Rock Slag, Trip. Pleased to meet you, Slag. Wow! That dog disguise is terrific! Yes, I\\'ve got a million of them. Watch.

Hey, sounds like an elegant idea, pal. And I know an elegant place to get it. Where\\'s that, Fred? Italy. Where else? ALL: Italy?! Sure. We\\'ll grab a plane for Rome and find a nice restaurant. But all the way to Italy, just to get an Italian dinner? Hey, I guess we\\'re lucky he isn\\'t in the mood for Chinese food. Ah heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh! WILMA: Rome by moonlight. Ah, it\\'s so beautiful, isn\\'t it, Fred? Yeah. You know something, Wilma? If we were here a long time ago, I\\'d be down there in that garden, serenading you. Really, Fred? Uh-huh.

Keep-a you shirt on! Chief? You in here? There\\'s a girl in this restaurant asking for Rock Slag. Hey, that\\'s me. Right, and she\\'s going to tell you where to pick up the Green Goose. Great. How will I know her? You say, \"50 flying firefighters,\" and she\\'ll answer, Bubala. Bubala, huh? I\\'ll go find her right away, chief. Pardon me, madame. Ya? Oh, Rock, my little cabbage! I\\'m so happy to see you again. Uh, 50 flighty firefighters. Oh, Rock, where have you been? You\\'re supposed to answer Bubala. Bubala. You called me Bubala. Oh, Rock! Oh ho! Rock? Where are you?

What are you doing under the table, Fred? I\\'m, uh, uh-- Just tying my shoe. You\\'re not wearing any, Fred. Uh, uh, yeah. Hey, now why don\\'t we all go dancing or something? I\\'m too tired, Fred. I think Barney and I will call it a night. See you in the morning, Wilma. Good night, Betty. Uh, night, you two. I\\'m not tired, Fred. I\\'d love to go dancing. You just made yourself a date, honey. We\\'ll find ourselves a good night club and a great band, and whip it up. Oh, it sounds like fun. Shh! It\\'s me. How did you make out, Flintstone? You gave me a bum steer, Chief. Nobody called me Bubala. Hmm. There\\'s another girl in the garden. She may be the right one. OK, I\\'ll go talk to her, but first I gotta keep Wilma busy. Will we be staying out late, Fred? Uh, yeah. Why don\\'t you put Pebbles in with Betty and Barney, and then while you\\'re doing that I\\'ll phone ahead and reserve a table. All right. I\\'ll wait for you upstairs.

Oh, yes, my darling, I know. My brother Mario, he\\'s-a come here for the wedding. How nice! Whose wedding? Ours! Well, I hope you\\'ll be very happy. Ours?! Let\\'s-a go. Where? To get the licence. Uh...oh...sure. Eh...after you, my dear. Hee hee hee hee. Oh... Oh, we\\'ll-a be so happy, Rockello! Rockello? Mario, Rockello, he\\'s-a gone! Have you found him yet, Mario? Not yet, little sister. Aha! Stop! Stop! This-a way, Roberta! This is far enough, driver. Oui, monsieur. Hey, taxi! Taxi! Let\\'s see... Paris to Rome... That will be 1 million francs, monsieur. How much? How about for free, oui? Hey, taxi! Wait for me! All right, cabbie. Beat it. Wait! Hold that cab! Wait! [Panting] G-gentlemen... please h-help me get outta here. There\\'s a couple after me who think I\\'m somebody else. It\\'s Rock Slag! Ha ha! He doesn\\'t recognize us. Must have took too many knocks on the head. Sure, mister! We help you. Yeah, yeah. We\\'ll hide you... permanently. Hee hee! Hee hee hee! Hee hee! Hee hee! I sure appreciate this, fellas. ROBERTA: Rockello! Blast off, fellas, quick! Darling! Don\\'t-a worry. We follow. Here they come! And they\\'re gaing on us! Faster, Mario! Faster! We\\'ll lose them on the steps. Hang on! No good! They\\'re still coming! I make a fast left up the next alley. Here\\'s one. Hey, fellas! Wait! Oh, boy! I can\\'t stop this thing! Uh-oh! A tour of Rome would be great but this is ridiculous! Help! Rockello! Here she comes! Oh, brother. What a spot to be in. Don\\'t stop. He must be on that train! They\\'re gone. Now to get back to the hotel. Oh, no! Rome, 50 miles? And I told Wilma I\\'d be back in 5 minutes. Oh, boy. How will I ever explain this to Wilma? Hey, bud. Who, me? Yeah, You. Wanna buy some genuine Italian leopard skin ties? No, thanks. I have a tie. Shaving lotion, nail clippers, hubcaps, fountain pens, a gold watch? I don\\'t need anything. Then how about something for the little lady, like a genuine imitation diamond necklace, maybe? A diamond necklace? Are you sure it\\'s a real genuine imitation diamond necklace? I guarantee it. Wow! How much? Would you consider a dollar and a quarter? It\\'s yours for 2 bits, bud. I don\\'t know if this\\'ll square me with Wilma, but it\\'s worth a try. She\\'ll probably throw a lamp at me the minute I walk in, but here goes. Wilma! Look, surprise. I spent all night shopping...for...it... Well, what do you know? She\\'s asleep. [Riiing] Fred? Morning, Wilma. Wha--wh--whe-- What time is it, Fred? dear. I slept all night! Why didn\\'t you wake me? Aw, you looked so comfortable, I didn\\'t have the heart to, sweetheart. Oh, Fred, I ruined your whole evening! I feel terrible! Perfectly all right, honey. Think nothing of it. Oh, you\\'re so wonderful. I\\'ll fix some breakfast while you get dressed. OK, sweetheart. Boy, that was close. This spy job is too much for me. I gotta find the Chief and quit. Look, Fred. There\\'s a park across the street. Let\\'s take the children there after breakfast. Good idea. I\\'ll tell Barney and Betty about it. I\\'ll be right back, Wilma. Now to find Triple X. He can take me to the Chief. What luck! Here he comes. I was just lookin\\' for you, Triple X. I gotta see the Chief. Very important. Yeeow! Triple X is such a master of disguise, he could be anyone. Excuse me, sonny. Even an old lady. Triple X, right? Fresh. [Baby cries] Hey, Trip! Take me to the Chief, will ya? Well, he\\'s not up here. I\\'ll take the elevator down to the lobby. Flintstone! Chief! How did you find my secret headquarters? Secret? In an elevator? Get in here, quick! OK, OK. I wanna talk to you, Chief. Hold it, Flintstone. This room may be bugged. Bugged? Nothing there. Chief, I\\'m quittin\\' this job right now. You can\\'t quit. Not before you pick up the Green Goose. Oh, anybody can pick up a bird. You don\\'t need me for that. Quiet. [Beep beep beep beep] How about that? They had my bed bugged! All right, Flintstone. I see I\\'m going to have to level with you. What do you mean? I mean the Green Goose is not a bird. He\\'s a master criminal who plans to take over the world! Why don\\'t you arrest him? No one knows who he is or what he looks like. But you can find out. Me?! How? Through a girl named Tanya who thinks you\\'re Rock Slag. The minute she identifies the Green Goose, I\\'ll grab him, and your job is done. How about it, Flintstone? Nothin\\' doin\\'! Too dangerous! I got a family to think of-- Pebbles\\' future! If we don\\'t stop the Green Goose, Pebbles won\\'t have a future. Sorry, Chief. You\\'ll have to get somebody else. Oh, look at those children, Fred. They\\'re having the time of their lives! BARNEY: Ha ha ha! Why not? They got nothin\\' to worry about. Right, Fred? Huh? I said those kids got nothin\\' to worry about. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I wonder... â\\x99ª Someday â\\x99ª â\\x99ª I\\'m gonna be a great doctor â\\x99ª â\\x99ª And cure every deadly disease â\\x99ª â\\x99ª You wait and see â\\x99ª â\\x99ª I\\'m gonna help other children â\\x99ª â\\x99ª Like me â\\x99ª â\\x99ª When I am grown up â\\x99ª â\\x99ª You\\'ll see â\\x99ª â\\x99ª We know that some day â\\x99ª â\\x99ª We will do great things â\\x99ª â\\x99ª When we are grown up â\\x99ª â\\x99ª You\\'ll see â\\x99ª â\\x99ª We know when we\\'re grown up â\\x99ª â\\x99ª And not so small â\\x99ª â\\x99ª We\\'re gonna do great things â\\x99ª â\\x99ª You\\'ll see â\\x99ª â\\x99ª and show them all â\\x99ª â\\x99ª Someday â\\x99ª â\\x99ª I\\'m gonna be a great farmer â\\x99ª â\\x99ª And grow lots of good things to eat â\\x99ª â\\x99ª Won\\'t that be neat? â\\x99ª â\\x99ª No one will ever go hungry again â\\x99ª â\\x99ª Not when I\\'m grown up â\\x99ª â\\x99ª Not then â\\x99ª â\\x99ª We know that some day â\\x99ª â\\x99ª We will do great things â\\x99ª â\\x99ª When we are grown up â\\x99ª â\\x99ª You\\'ll see â\\x99ª â\\x99ª We know when we\\'re grown up â\\x99ª â\\x99ª And not so small â\\x99ª â\\x99ª We\\'re gonna do great things â\\x99ª â\\x99ª You\\'ll see â\\x99ª â\\x99ª and show them all â\\x99ª â\\x99ª Some day â\\x99ª â\\x99ª I\\'m gonna be a great teacher â\\x99ª â\\x99ª And teach everybody to read â\\x99ª â\\x99ª That\\'s what we need â\\x99ª â\\x99ª People who read aren\\'t so easy to fool â\\x99ª â\\x99ª So I will teach them â\\x99ª â\\x99ª In school â\\x99ª â\\x99ª We know that some day â\\x99ª â\\x99ª We will do great things â\\x99ª â\\x99ª When we are grown up â\\x99ª â\\x99ª You\\'ll see â\\x99ª â\\x99ª Someday â\\x99ª â\\x99ª You\\'ll see â\\x99ª â\\x99ª Some day â\\x99ª â\\x99ª You\\'ll see â\\x99ª â\\x99ª Someday â\\x99ª â\\x99ª I\\'m gonna be â\\x99ª Isn\\'t it wonderful the way kids get along together? Yeah. We adults could take a lesson from them. What do we do now, Fred, some sightseeing? Fred? Do you hear me? What? Oh, uh, yeah, yeah. Good idea. You, uh...go ahead and enjoy yourselves. But aren\\'t you coming with us? No. I got some unfinished business to take care of. So long, honey. See you later. My, he\\'s acting strange. I wonder what\\'s wrong? I knew you\\'d change your mind, Flintstone. You\\'re A-OK. Are you sure this is the right girl? Absolutely. You\\'re having lunch with her at Papa Piccolo\\'s Pizza Palace. Here we are, Flintstone. Let\\'s go inside. There she is. Tanya. The girl who will lead us to the Green Goose\\'s hideout. Rrr! She\\'s a doll. Your job will be simpler than we thought, Flintstone. Rock Slag has recovered and will be here within a hour. All you have to do is keep Tanya here until he arrives. Think you can do it? It\\'ll be a cinch. I\\'ll order everything on the menu. Wait. I want you to wear this recorder. Recorder? Yes. We wanna take down everything Tanya says. I\\'m glad I had my beak sharpened. Tanya may be a real yacker. This flower is the microphone. And remember, keep her talking until the real Rock Slag takes over. Gotcha, Chief. BETTY: Oh, how exciting! The famous Papa Piccolo\\'s Pizza Palace. Let\\'s go in and have some lunch. Poor Fred. It\\'s a shame he isn\\'t here. Fifty flying firefighters? Mmm... Bubala! Ha ha ha. Hello, Tanya. Rock Slag. At last we meet. May I sit down? Is that wise? We should leave at once. Oh, plenty of time. Let\\'s have a little talk first about, uh... you know who. Oh, the Green Goose. He\\'s a terrible man! Do you know he has a secret weapon more powerful than any? A little louder, please, and speak into the flower. How cute. I will wear it in my hair. No, no, no. Allow me to get you a fresh flower. I\\'ll be right back. Toodle-oo! Fred! Wilma! What are you doing here? And who are you waving at? Wa-wa-waving? Who--who\\'s waving? Oh, that! Ha ha ha! It\\'s just a loose wrist. I thought you had some unfinished business to take care of. Well, I do. That is, I finished. I took a chance you might be here, so...ha ha... here I am. Oh, how nice! Well, sit down, Fred. Yeah! Join the party. Huh? Oh, yeah. yeah. Will you excuse me a minute? It\\'s kinda drafty in here. I\\'ll go close the window. Sorry. I couldn\\'t find a flower. Oh, that\\'s all right. It\\'s kinda drafty in here. I\\'ll go close the window. Excuse me. What took you so long, dear? I was stuck. I mean the window was stuck. Well, should we order? Yeah. Good idea. Uh-oh. Excuse me! Tanya, what are you doing? Getting my wrap. We must leave! Look, t-the orchestra\\'s gettin\\' ready to play. Let\\'s dance. Well...maybe just once. [Slow song starts] I\\'d sure like to dance. I wonder where Fred is. Uh-oh. What are you doing, Rock? In this business, you can\\'t be too careful. [Upbeat song starts] It\\'s Fred! I didn\\'t know you wanted to dance, honey. Wilma! Uh-oh! Oh, you dance divinely, darling. So do you, dear. Dear? Darling? Come on, Tiger. Let\\'s get out of here. Tiger? So that\\'s it! That\\'s your unfinished business. L-l-look, Wilma, I--I can explain everything. I wish you would. I\\'ve been going crazy down there trying to record it. There\\'s nothing to explain. It\\'s all very obvious! Wilma, please, won\\'t ya listen? I\\'m going home...Tiger! Hey, Flintstone. Rock Slag\\'s cab is arriving. Go get Tanya. You can switch with Slag in the lobby. Hurry! Taxi! Allow me, madame. Don\\'t you get smart with me, Fred Flintstone! So we see you in your true colours, you playboy! How could you do that to the mother of your child? Consider our friendship ended! You playboy! Rock! Oh, no, not again. You powder your nose, Tanya. I\\'ll wait for ya in the lobby. All set, Chief. Where\\'s Rock? Right there. What happened? He must have had a relapse. Look! Rock Slag! Quick, upstairs! Looks like you\\'re going to have to carry the ball a little longer, Flintstone. Me? I gotta go home and square myself with Wilma! No time for that now! I just got this message. Listen. Green Goose\\r\\nsecret weapon\\r\\n\\r\\n1371\\r\\n01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:32,119\\r\\nis giant inter-rockinental missile. our anti-missile missile is not operational yet.\" So you see, it\\'s up to us to stop the Green Goose! Us? What do you mean us? You go with Tanya to the Green Goose\\'s hideout. I\\'ll phone Triple X, and we\\'ll follow right behind you. Now just a minute. That wasn\\'t the deal-- I\\'m ready, Rock. Let\\'s go. But--but--but--but--- Oh, boy. Hello, operator? Hello, hello? Operator, are you there? [Crash] Hee hee! Hee hee! Hee hee hee hee! Right on target, Bobo. Thanks, Ali. Now we get Rock Slag. No time. First we must take message to Green Goose. Good idea, Ali. Green Goose will be proud of us. Bwa ha ha ha! Here we are, Rock. The Green Goose\\'s secret headquarters. An abandoned amusement park. Pretty clever. OK, Rock. Now what? Follow me. Follow me, Chief, wherever you are. Why do you keep looking behind you? Oh, I just wanted to make sure we were being followed. I mean...we\\'renotbeing followed. Heh heh heh. Eh... The Green Goose is in there. I\\'ll go in first and get behind him. Then when you come in, I will drop this rope over him. Count to 5 before you break in. OK. We\\'re movin\\' in! All right, Goose! You\\'re cooked! Ah...Mr Slag! Nice of you to drop in. Shall I tie him up? That won\\'t be necessary. Ferocious wouldn\\'t like it if Mr Slag tried to leave. Would you, Ferocious? [Growls] Hey, what is this? What\\'s goin\\' on, Tanya? My dear Rock, the Green Goose needs some information. So we set up this little trap for you. Surprised? A double cross, huh? Well, now I have a surprise for you! OK, Chief, come in! Oh, uh, there you are. Barney! Yeah, Barney. I followed you here. I\\'m not leaving until I get some information! Exactly what I was saying. Hey, who are you, buster? And why are you wearing this-- [Rrr] Eh, ahem, look, Goose, this guy is just a friend of mine. Why don\\'t you let him go? Oh, come now, Mr Slag, you know that\\'s impossible! Mr Slag? Who\\'s that? That\\'s me. I\\'ll explain later. GOOSE: Slag? I know your government has been working on an anti-missile missile. I want to know if they have completed it. I don\\'t know anything about it. GOOSE: I\\'d advise you to cooperate. I\\'d hate to resort to using unpleasant methods. [Grrr] Unpleasant methods? What\\'s going on? This guy is a master criminal and I\\'m helping the government capture him. But don\\'t worry. Our agents will bust in any minute. You don\\'t scare me, Goose. No? What about your chubby friend? Uh-oh. I, uh... I just rembered I--I double parked outside. I\\'ll be right back. Ferocious! [Grrr] [Grrr--grrr-grrr] [Evil laughter] Oh, oh, oh! Oh! GOOSE: Not yet, Ferocious. I may need him. Tanya! Show them the torture chamber! [Creak] These are some of my toys, but I want you to see my latest one. It\\'s called anerocktric chair. We strap you in and... Quite effective, isn\\'t it? Ab-bout my car. I--I left my lights on, too. Can I turn \\'em off? Take it easy, Barn. Help will be here any second. You\\'ll get nothin\\' out of me, Green Goose! I knew it would be useless to even try withyou, Slag, but your chubby little friend is another story, isn\\'t he? Heh heh heh. Tanya, the rack! FRED: Hey! Hey! What are you doin\\' to Barney?! Perhaps when you see what happens to your friend you\\'ll tell me what I want to know. Yeow! You can\\'t intimidate me with these crude methods. I\\'m intimi-nated! Yeow! Talk, Slag. Never! BARNEY: Yeow! Talk! No! BARNEY: Yeow! Don\\'t worry, Barn. All we gotta do is stall him a little longer. My lips are sealed, Goose! BARNEY: Yeow! Slag, you\\'re superhuman. I\\'ve never met anyone like you. Zounds! How much pain can a man stand? All you can dish out and more. BARNEY: Yeow! Don\\'t worry, Barney. I can take it. You ain\\'t takin\\' it. I am! You\\'re gonna come outta this abig man! And a thin one, too! [Knock, knock] At last! It\\'s about time. I was beginnin\\' to think you wouldn\\'t show up. Chief? If you\\'re expecting Chief Boulder, he\\'s out-- out cold for the evening. That\\'s right. And we found this message on him. Hmm... Green Goose\\r\\nsecret weapon\\r\\n\\r\\n1537\\r\\n01:14:10,451 --> 01:14:13,287\\r\\nis giant inter-rockinental missile. our anti-missile missile is not operational yet.\" Ha ha ha ha! Good work, Ali. Release the prisoner, Tanya. I have the information I need. Lock those two up and prepare to launch missile. Nobody can stop me now! Mwa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! So that\\'s the way it was, Barney. Just because I happen to look like Rock Slag, I got the plane tickets, money, everything, and I also got you into this mess-- my best friend. Well, uh, could be worse, Fred. At least Betty and Wilma and the kids are OK. Yeah. I wonder if we\\'ll ever see \\'em again. Hey, Slag! Chowtime! Hee hee! Hee hee! Hee hee hee hee! Oh, boy, food. Oh, I\\'m starved. [Slurp] Fred: Barney! Don\\'t eat that stuff! I couldn\\'t if I wanted to, Fred. No spoon. Looks like the Green Goose is tryin\\' to get rid of us, Barney. We\\'ve gotta get outta here and find that missile. Oh, I wonder where it could be. Enh heh heh heh heh heh heh! The Fun House. I hope our guests are enjoying their last moments. This amusement park is the perfect launching spot. Who would think that the space ride isreallya deadly missile? No one. Now, let\\'s prepare to launch. Hey--hey, Fred, you sure you know what you\\'re doin\\'? This tower is 100-feet high, and you\\'ve got an awful short tie. Don\\'t worry. We\\'ll make it. Oh, e-easy, Fred. Howya doin\\', Barn? You think you can jump the rest of the way? Are you kiddin\\'? Pull me up! Pull me up! Uh-oh! He-elp! Faster, Barney! Faster! Hurry, Barney! Hurry! Oh, nice goin\\', Fred. You nearly got me killed. What are you complain\\' about? That was my best tie you ruined. Oh, sorry, Fred. Guess we never will get outta here. Hey, Barney, look. What is it? The guards-- They\\'re asleep, and the key is hangin\\' on the desk. So what good does that-- Shh! Quiet. Oh, uh, sorry, Fred, but, uh, how are we gonna get the key? [WHISPERING] That\\'s what we gotta figure out. Hey, would you mind speakin\\' a little louder? I can\\'t hear a word you\\'re saying. Well, whaddya know? The tape recorder. How would you like to do us a little favour? What kind of a little favour? Oh, nothin\\' much. You see that key? What about it? Just fly over there and bring it back to me. Unh-uh. I\\'m a recorder, not a retriever. But you\\'ve got to. It\\'s our only chance to get outta here. All right, All right, simmer down. I\\'ll give it a try. Shh! Turn around. Whoops! Oh, no! Sorry, it slipped. But don\\'t worry. I\\'ll get it. Just put me down and relax. What\\'s he gonna do, Fred? Beats me. RECORDER: Whoa! I\\'m hurt! The old wing is shot. Woe is me! I can\\'t fly anymore. Never again to zoom into the wild blue. Isn\\'t that an awful thing to happen to poor little me? [Grrr] Get ready! Here comes the pigeon! [Grr] Come on, bird! Come on! Open up! Barney, I got it! I got the key! I just hope the union never hears about this. [Muffled yells] Hold it, Barney. That door might lead to a trap. You better let me check first. OK, Fred. It\\'s OK, Barn. Come on. Barney, where are you? Let me go! Let me go! Take it easy, Rock. It\\'s only me, Triple X. Oh, boy, am I glad to see you. Where ya been? What took you so long? Where\\'s the Chief? One question at a time, please. Sorry. Here. You dropped your hat... and your hanky. Hey, that\\'s funny, Triple X. The Green Goose was wearin\\' a mask like this. He was? What a very clever disguise, don\\'t you think? Now, may I have it back, please? You mean... this is your mask? Heh heh heh heh... heh heh heh heh! Yes, exactly. Boo-hoo hoo hoo hoo! Then you\\'re-- you\\'re the Green Goose. And you\\'re a dead duck. Ali, Bobo, over here! Oh, no, you don\\'t! Come back, you! Never mind! I\\'m going to fire the missile. Come on. Hee hee! Hee hee hee! Hee hee! Hee hee! Ha ha ha! BO: Oh, boy! Big fireworks. ALI: Whole world go boom! Hee hee! Hee hee hee! Hee hee! Hee hee! The missile. I gotta stop \\'em! I wonder where Barney is. Maybe he could-- He-elp! [Grr] Take it easy, Ferocious. Can\\'t we sorta talk this over? [Grr--] Fred, oh, boy, am I glad to see you. Ferocious wasn\\'t gonna wait till lunchtime. Come on, Barney. There\\'s no time to lose. [Green Goose cackles] This is the big moment, gentlemen. First, I set the directional control. Then I set the firing pin. When the countdown reaches zero, The blade will snap back, cut the rope, and the missile will take off. Oh, Goose, you are a genius. Oh, you are so right. In a matter of minutes, the whole world will know of my power, and I alone shall rule supreme. [Buzz] Ah ha ha ha ha ha! We\\'ve got to find that missile, Barney. It\\'s all up to us now. Hey, Fred, look-- The Green Goose. Hold on, Barney! We\\'re crashin\\' through. Stop them, Bobo! Right. Ahh...Mr Slag, We meet again. But too late for you to stop me! Run, Barney! Run! Head for the space ride, Barney. We can hide in there. Oh! It\\'s locked. Uh, press the button. [Buzz] Inside, quick. Green Goose: Don\\'t open that door! Our friends have trapped themselves in the missile. Well, we no longer need concern ourselves with them. Hey, didya hear that, Fred? Yeah, Barney. We found the missile. Well--well, what can we do? Nothin\\' to save ourselves, but we can aim the missile into space, where it won\\'t do any harm. At least that\\'s somethin\\'. Oh, boy. Payload in an interplanetary projectile. Oh! What a way to go! They say we all gotta go sometime, Barn. Too bad I\\'ll never get the chance to give Wilma this present. Wow, Fred, where\\'d you get that? BARNEY: It must be worth millions! Huh? Nah. No, it\\'s only worth, uh... uh... It\\'s only worthone million. Just think, Barney-- we\\'ll be the richest guys in space. A million! Slag! Heh heh heh! I\\'ll make a deal with you. I\\'ll swap you your lives for that necklace. On your toes, Barn. It\\'s a deal. [Buzz] Hand it out. Here you are! [Crash] [Thud] Yii! Ali! Bobo! Tanya! Help! [Buzz] Let--let me out! No, no! Let me out! Help! Well, that\\'s what always happens to guys who want to take over the world. Yeah. Heh heh heh! They end up out of it. And with great pride, we, the citizens of Bedrock, present you with this medal. [Cheering] [Signal beeping] ANNOUNCER: After a week of parties, parades, and speeches, public hero Fred Flintstone has slipped away for a well-earned rest. Only clue as to his whereabouts is a note saying Gone fishing. Oh, it feels so good to relax. Yeah. It\\'s been one parade after another. My Fred, a big hero. Oh, I\\'m so proud of you. Oh...hee hee! Forget the hero stuff. Forget everything that happened in Eurock. From now on, I am just Fred Flintstone, average citizen. Besides, Barney deserves as much credit as I do. Oh, yeah, yeah. I deserve as much credit as Fred. Well, now, wait a minute, Barn. I was the one that-- Ha ha! [Girls laugh] Aw...ha ha ha! Now, cut it out, cut it out. Hey, come on, Fred.
